TO: IT Manager, Stakeholders  
FROM: Renato Ferreira  
DATE: February 14, 2024  
SUBJECT: Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations  

Dear Colleagues,  

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary and recommendations.  

## Scope:
<br>

- Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, end point
detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information and event
management (SIEM) tool.

- Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, end point
detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, Security Information and Event
Management (SIEM) tool.
- Current procedures and protocols set for the following systems: accounting,
end point detection, firewall, intrusion detection system, Security Information
and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
- Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols in place
align with necessary compliance requirements.
- Ensure current technology is accounted for. Both hardware and system access.


## Goals:
<br>

- To adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity
Framework (NIST CSF)
- Establish a better process for their systems to ensure they are compliant
- Fortify system controls
- Implement the concept of least permissions when it comes to user credential
management
- Establish their policies and procedures, which includes their playbooks
- Ensure they are meeting compliance requirements


## Critical findings (must be addressed immediately): 
<br>

- Least Privilege - manage employee and third-party permissions with the network
- Disaster Recovery Plans - Guidelines on how to keep the business running in the event of a breach
- Password Policies - Increased safety and complexity of passwords in order to prevent breaches through employee accounts
- Access Control Policies - Determine which employees should and should not have access to certain data or assets
- Account Management Policies
- Separations of Duties - Ensure duties are divided up between people so that one sole person does not have to much access or responsibility
- Intrusion Detection System - Help analysts detect anomalies in the network in order to prevent further damages from breaches.
- Backups - Creating backups in the event that a breach causes large amounts of damage to data or other systems is integral 
- Antivirus - Using programs to aid in protecting the network against malware
- Encryption - Ensures data is safe from unauthorized access by making it unreadable without a description key
- Manual Monitoring - Legacy systems can be a vulnerability in any network due to their outdated and often neglected nature, providing threat actors with an easier way into the network, regardless of what newer systems are using
- CCTV - In the event of a physical breach, this can help with investigations into intrusions
- Locking Cabinets - Keeping physical assets such as server locked helps prevent unauthorized access for a physical threat actor
- Locks - Using locks to secure rooms and assets is important in order to prevent physical intrusions
- Compliance with GDPR, PCI DSS, SOC1, SOC2 - Operating outside of the compliance of these regulations can result in major fines and consequences in the event that a breach occurs within the company

## Findings (should be addressed, but no immediate need): 
<br>

- Time-controlled Safe - An extra precaution for storing sensitive data
- Adequate Lighting - Helps with CCTV investigations in order to make video easier to view
- Password Management System - Makes resetting and helping employees with their passwords easier while also sending alerts if too many wrong attempts are made in the case of an attempted breach
- Signage Indicating Alarm Service - Can be a deterrent to threat actors if they see signage indicating their alarm service provider
- Fire Detection/Prevention - As with all electrical devices, a fire risk is always there and in order to prevent the destruction of hardware, a fire detection system should be implemented

## Summary/Recommendations: 
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, many of the current cybersecurity practices need to be implemented and/or revamped in order to meet industry standards as well as comply with various regulations and standards relating to international sales and privacy. There is an extensive list of systems that need to be put into place in order to demonstrate better security posture and to mitigate risk to the company, assets, and people. Some less urgent matters also need to be addressed but they are of lower risk than the ones previously stated.
